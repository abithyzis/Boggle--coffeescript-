<p>
This is an implementation of the Boggle game from Parker Brothers.  
<p>
It is a single-player game without scoring.  It is really just done as an academic exercise.
If you are looking for a full-featured online game, keep googling!

To try this out:
<pre>
 git clone git://github.com/showell/Boggle--coffeescript-.git
 cd Boggle--coffeescript-/ && open boggle.htm
</pre>
